# DS-MiniSQL

MiniSQL is a simple prototype of a relational database supporting a subset of SQL language. It consists of SQL parser, catalog manager, index manager and record manager. 

This is *not* a efficient implementation of any database, it's just a project to enhance our knowledge of database and OOD.

MiniSQL was developed by:
* Ran Xian, Peking University
* Qimu Zheng, Peking University
* Tianyu Zhao, Peking University

## Build and run

```
$> cd src
$> make clean
$> make cleand
$> make
$> ./minisql
```

Then you can refer to the file `TestCommand` under `test` directory to test the function of MiniSQL.
